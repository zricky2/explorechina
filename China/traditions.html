              China is one of the oldest cultures on the planet, and has made famed contributions to all kinds of art, literature, architecture, engineering, and more. Western audiences would be most familiar with China's architecture, specifically the Great Wall of China (which, contrary to popular belief, cannot be seen from space with the naked eye). Fortifications aside, Chinese architecture has many famous characteristics; readers might be familiar with the use of sweeping gables on prominent buildings. More specific stylings can vary dramatically from region to region. Chinese architecture has been vastly influential on neighboring countries, and contact with the West only furthered its global reach. Chinese architecture has, like in the West, grown and developed over time and after contact with foreign cultures. Shanghai in the early twentieth century adapted many Western ideas and aesthetics to create their own unique style, like with the city's famous shikumen houses. The country is also home to many striking examples of contemporary architecture, like the national stadium in Beijing.

              China is very famous for its culinary tradition--not just the typical "Chinese food" you find dotting malls and shopping plazas, but a whole cornucopia of cuisines with incredible depth and variety. There are eight major cuisines in China; Anhui, Cantonese, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangsu, Shandong, Sichuan, and Zhejiang. There are also many more regional varieties. China's vast landscape, ranging from tropical to desert to subarctic, has produced many different kinds of food and methods of cooking; these methods and base ingredients differ from the Italian/French-derived landscape of European cuisine, and throughout history Chinese cuisine has been imbued with great importance and artistry. For several thousand years, food in China has been seen as important to healthy living, and even today Chinese food therapy is highly popular.
